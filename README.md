# WEEE-Disassembly-Screw-Dataset
Paper Title : Vision-Enhanced System for Human-Robot Disassembly Factory Cells: Introducing A New Screw Dataset

2022 4th International Conference on Robotics and Computer Vision (ICRCV 2022)

The dataset might be referred to as **WDSD** : **W**EEE **D**isassembly **S**crew **D**ataset 

Dataset Statistics:
- 945 images 

- Total Screw instances 4414

- Avg = 5 Screws/image

- Min screws/image = 1 | Max screws/image = 15

- Industrial Environment images : 390 --> 41.3% Laboratory Environment : 555 --> 58.7%

- Annotations for 3 Computer Vision Tasks : Object detection(COCO format), Instance segmentation(COCO format), Semantic segmentation

- Dataset Split --> 0.8/0.1/0.1 --> 765/90/90
- 
- High Definition (HD) Images 1280x720 --> 720P-HD

- Three different types of WEEE devices : PC Towers, Microwave Ovens, Flat Panel Displays [35% - 330 images/ 41% - 387 images/ 24% - 228 images]

- Damaged devices, Deformable devices, Big variability between devices

- Multiple-camera setup resulted in more informative views, recordings from near and far distances and with different angle shots, cameras in fixed positions, different lighting conditions, rotations and movement of devices, camera mount on the Screwdriver, Hand-held camera.
